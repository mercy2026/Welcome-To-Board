# Welcome-To-Board
It is an interactive board game, where the player is an architect that has to build a neighborhood 
They create the neighborhood by filling up each of the houses on the sheet, with numbers.
In this game there was a deck of cards. Each card will have a number and a corresponding action (Market, Fence, Pool, Park, Bis, and Construction). 
Each round 3 cards will be revealed from the deck. The player will choose which one out of the three they will pick to place on one of their houses.
The only catch is that the houses must go in ascending order.

The Goal is to score the most points, by strategically placing house numbers and using the actions to your advantage.

Some strategies:
- Completing city plans
- Consider the low or higher number early.
- Save Bis for when you need
- Look at your fence placement
